# FXREPORTING

The assumptions made in this Project are  the followings:
1)  All the data will be in memory.
2)  We are assuming that the Report Generation will occur after all the exchanges are closed 
    i.e after NY (EOD) and before the start of TK (EOD)
3)  Timezone evaluations are avoided.	
4)  ReportGeneration is the main class which will start the application.
